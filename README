JavaScript Catalog Slideshow v1.0

Display your catalogs or book in an elegant, mobile-friendly format.

JavaScript Catalog Slideshow is a jQuery plugin that creates a book-like slideshow using an array of images.  The array allows the user to easily add or interchange spreads/pages in the middle of the book or catalog.  It works on every modern browser including IE.  It zooms in on each page of a spread separately, to maximize the area available for the zoom, thereby rendering text and images more clearly. Its dependencies are jQuery and the jQuery Fancybox plugin.  

The biggest difference between this slideshow and others is that it lays out two pages or images side-by-side in order to create a spread.  It also displays single pages for the front cover and back covers.  JavaScript catalog slideshow is ideal for displaying print catalogs on the web without relying on a Flash flip book, which is not compatible with many mobile devices.  It also does not include one of those ubiquitous page flip animations.
